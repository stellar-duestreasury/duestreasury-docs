# Contributing

Thanks for helping with `duestreasury`. **Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first** — it is
the rulebook for this repository, for people and for AI agents alike. This page
is a shorter orientation.

## Before you change anything

- **Testnet only.** Never write anything that suggests mainnet use.
- **Nothing is deployed and no pilot has happened.** Do not describe a
  deployment, a contract id, a user, a tester or a result that does not exist.
- **No personal data, ever** — not in examples, not in tests, not in issue
  drafts. Use obvious placeholders.
- **Never commit `.env`**, a secret key or a seed phrase.

## Commits

- One logical change per commit; subject `type: imperative summary`, 72
  characters or fewer.
- Stage by explicit file name and read the staged diff before committing.
- No "Generated with" or co-author trailers of any kind.

## Checks to run before you push

Run `node --test` and `node scripts/check-links.mjs`. CI also builds mdBook.
Trace every claim to implemented code or recorded checks, keep TODO(verify)
for unverified behavior, and preserve the deployment block and second human
custody review requirement. No deployment or pilot evidence is invented.
